# Fuzzy C-Means Clustering
Welcome to the Fuzzy C-Means Clustering repository! This repository hosts an implementation of the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm from scratch, a powerful tool in the realm of clustering and data analysis.

# Introduction
# .Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) is a widely used clustering algorithm that offers a flexible and intuitive approach to partitioning data into clusters. Unlike traditional crisp clustering algorithms, FCM assigns membership degrees to data points, allowing for a soft assignment of points to clusters. This characteristic makes FCM particularly useful in scenarios where data points may belong to multiple clusters simultaneously or when dealing with noisy or ambiguous data.


In this repository, we provide an implementation of the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm along with usage examples and documentation to help you leverage its benefits in your projects. Whether you're exploring the structure of your data, FCM can be a valuable addition to your toolkit.
